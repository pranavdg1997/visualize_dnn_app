# visualize_dnn_app

Using this app, we visualize how neural networks act as feature extractors. Across layers and accross epochs of training, we compress the data in 2d /3d space using TSNe/PCA/other similar methods, then proceed to visualize them using plotly. We then color code each point and observe cluster formation, and there's also the option of looking up inidividual data point to note outliers.
